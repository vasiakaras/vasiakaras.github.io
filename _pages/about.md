I am Master’s candidate in [Forensic Psychology](https://carleton.ca/psychology/research/research-areas/forensic/) at Carleton University, advised by [Dr. Adelle Forth](https://carleton.ca/fprc/people/adelle-forth/). My research focuses on online behaviors and technology-facilitated sexual violence. My thesis, titled “iPredator: Risk Factors and Motivators of Image-Based Sexual Abuse”, explores the demographic, personality, and attitudinal factors associated with Image-based sexual abuse perpetration and victimization. 

In 2018, I graduated with a BSc in [Neuroscience and Mental Health](https://carleton.ca/neuroscience/) with a minor in Biology, and a BA in [Psychology](https://carleton.ca/psychology/) from Carleton University. I completed two thesis projects: a systematic review titled “The Fear Factor: Fear Deficits in Psychopathy as an Index of Limbic Dysregulation” under the supervision of Dr. Kavita Prakash, and a research paper titled “HPA Functioning in Healthy Twins: Investigation of the Effect of Concurrent ADHD and ODD Symptomatology”.

Some of my current research projects include examining the personality traits associated with sharing positive news online, developing and validating a scale on aggrieved entitlement, investigating factors associated with cyberflashing and the differences in cyberflashing expectations and reality, and a study on the personality traits associated with trolling and how trolls select victims.  

In my free time, I play Dungeons and Dragons and spend as much time in nature as I possibly can.
